            <h2>Some Travel Stories</h2>

            <p>Saudi Arabia

                I had been wanting to see this pavilion since I first saw it one night on a previous visit, but it always seemed crowded. So I came early and made it my first stop and it was easy to get in and out. It

                was very well done and just beautiful, though from the outside it seems huge so I expected it to take a bit longer. But I was through the whole thing in less than 10 minutes I think. Still, a lovely pavilion with examples of architecture by city on the escalator going up and then a big 3-D type of projection of various area within the country. (Opportunity)

                Same, finally got to see the usually busy USA pavilion early on and there was nobody in line. You ride on a moving platform through some of the US history, such as Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr, and Thomas Jefferson with his copy of the Quran. Then, something about innovation by kids. Then you walk past some pictures of the national parks as you go upstairs and see some space stuff in a large room, focusing on Mars. It was ok, but nothing special. (Al Forsan Park)

                I tried to visit here before one night, but they were putting on a show and it was quite busy. Today was a bit busy, but nothing crazy. And it was one of my favorites! You walk into the

                main room and my breath was just taken away - they really knew how to display the mirrors and plants to maximum effect, but they kind of rushed you through here to the side rooms, one of which discussed the geography of the country (I so want to visit now!) and the other which discussed some traditions and customs. I paused a few times to get some photos in the mirrored area, where they were constantly changing the lighting - so cool. Then you go to a room with shows the environment and shows how apples and tulips are endemic to the area. Then you go upstairs to an open area, the attendant had told me the show would start in two minutes. We were then put into the room which then had a dancer interacting with a robotic arm. At first I thought it was cheesy, which it was, but I also enjoyed it at the same time as I thought it sent a good message. (Al Forsan Park)
                
                Palestine
                
                This one had a fairly long line to enter, mostly because you had to wait for the elevator to take you upstairs where the tour mainly started.

                The outside was quite nice. I have to say... I'm not sure what was happening. There were a few items placed in random places and some curiously empty spaces. However, two things that I really enjoyed: first was the aroma room where you can smell certain herbs from various kiosks (one woman was hoarding the zaatar smell, so I just enjoyed my citrusy ones). The second was they really showed the various dishes that they are known for and my mouth was watering. Also, I really loved the artwork in the bottom exit hall where someone had painted four (I think) paintings of one woman in Palestine, from girl hood, enjoying nature, to elderly woman, seeing tanks and fences erected in the meadow. It was pretty powerful.</p> <br>
